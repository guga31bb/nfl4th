\item{first_down_prob}{Probability of earning a first down if going for it on 4th down.}
\item{wp_fail}{Win probability in the event of a failed 4th down attempt.}
\item{wp_succeed}{Win probability in the event of a successful 4th down attempt.}
\item{go_wp}{Average win probability when going for it on 4th down.}
\item{fg_make_prob}{Probability of making field goal.}
\item{miss_fg_wp}{Win probability in the event of a missed field goal.}
